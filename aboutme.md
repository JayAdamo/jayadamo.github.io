#Who I am
My name is Jason Adamo but please call me Jay,otherwise I feel like I am in trouble. After spending several years trying to find a career best suited for me I have ended up chasing a career in the Data Science field.   
#My skills
I have a variety of experiences as a technician in environmental regulation, an educator and most recently in human services where I have developed an excellent skillset for data science.  
 -effective communication
 -technical writing
 -presenting complex material in a language the average layman could interpret.  
#My future
Alas, here I am. I believe I have found my calling, but if not I am adding to my ever evolving skillset, accepting challenges as they come, as I am committed to being a life long learner. I see myself in this field, preferably where it does not snow!
