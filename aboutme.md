## Who I am  
My name is Jason Adamo but please call me Jay, otherwise I feel like I am in trouble. After spending several years looking for a career best suited for me I found data science. I would like to think of myself as a compassionate, problem-solver who wants to have a positive impact on this world. My passion is mostly anything outdoors, I get a real thrill from exploring and finding beautiful natural wonders. This adventurous spirit allows me to come out of my comfort zone when I need to. As a former educator I am a terrific public speaker and generally know my audience. I also have worked in the human services field which required a lot of technical writing and legal speak. Although I enjoy writing and speaking, I have to be passionate about the topics because this gives me a great deal of satisfaction.
