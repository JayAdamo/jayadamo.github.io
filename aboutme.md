My name is Jason Adamo but please call me Jay, otherwise I feel like I am in trouble. After spending several years trying to find a career best suited for me I have ended up chasing a career in the Data Science field. I have a variety of experiences as a technician in encironmental regulation, an educator and most recently in human services. 

All 3 of those fields were challenging but I did not feel a sense of satisfaction. The analytical part of my brain was underused. However from the aforementioned fields I have developed an excellent skill set such as effective communication, technical writing and presenting complex material in a language the average layman could interpret. 

Alas, here I am. Perhaps I found my calling, but if not I am adding to my ever evolving skillset, accepting challenges as they come, as I am committed to being a life long learnerner.
