Thank you for reading my first post! Currently I am a Data Science student at Lambda School. I am proud to say 
that I made it to the end of the first unit Statistics Fundamentals. It has been a challenging yet rewarding 
experience. I look forward to the journey ahead as I navigate through Predictive Modeling, Data Engineering, 
Machine Learning and Computer Science. I am excited for things to come, including future posts of the incredible projects I intend to display here.
