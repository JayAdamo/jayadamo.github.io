## Introduction  
Yellowstone National Park, best known for it's aptly named geyser "_Olde Faithful_", experienced an **enourmous increase in visitors from 1979 to 2018**. This project was intended to find the _**contrast of the number of visitors between the different seasons**_, and based on a rising interest in outdoor recreation, if there was an _**increase in the interest of visiting Yellowstone**_ specifically. I was able to address these questions using visitor data collected from the National Park Service as well as population data based on the United States census and worldometer.com. Let's dig in, shall we? 

## About Yellowstone  
This national park is **3,500 square miles of wilderness situated atop of a volcanic hot spot**. Although most of the park is in Wyoming, this recreation area spreads into parts of Montana and Idaho as well. In addition to the dramatic canyons, alpine rivers and lush forests, Yellowstone National park features **hot springs and gushing geysers**. This park also home to a variety of wildlife, including bears, wolves, bison, elk and antelope.

## Visitors 1979 - 2018 
During this 40 year span Yellowstone saw the number of guests increase from roughly 1.9 million in 1979 to an estimated 327 million in 2018.

> As you can see  from the graph above there is a general trend showing the increase in visitors. Take note of the peaks and valleys, or increases and decreases in visitors. Without facts one can only theorize that these sudden changes can be due weather conditions, the economy, or several other variables. Of course further research would have to be done to pinpoint the exact reasoning behind the rise and fall in the number of guests throught the years this data was collected.  

Okay, we got through that... Stay with me now as we look at when visitors flocked to the land of hot springs and geysers. 

## Visitors in Winter vs. Summer
I chose to compare the least busiest month of January to represent winter and the busiest month of July to represent summer. I also only picked years in intervals of ten starting with 1979, however the last year represented will be 2018.

During January there does not seem to be any signicance to an increase or decrease of visitors. In contrast there is a steady rise in the number of guests at Yellowstone in July. 

### Reasons for stagnation in winter
* Winter access is limited to snowshoes/x-country skiing, major roadways are not plowed
* Due to hibernation there is a decrease in wildlife activity
* Extreme cold temperatures, high winds and frequent snowstorms

Well you are probably thinking "no duh", who wants to be out in the wilderness in these conditions? Ok let's look at a comparison of May versus September.

## Visitors in Spring vs. Fall
Due the the higher elevation of this alpine region I chose May to represent Spring as it is the first months where the weather starts to become tolerable. September is a good representation of Fall as temperature starts to drop and the park may even experience snow. My thought was that these months will have more in common than the months of January and July, hoping both May and October showed an increase in visitors over the chosen years.

The results represented in the graph show a significant increase in visitors for both months. However, May had a much lower visitor count than September

### Possible reasons for the difference:
* May is most likely still a very wet month leaving camgrounds and trails a muddy mess
* September might bring out the leaf peepers and those taking last minute family vacations before school starts
* September is probably the ideal month to visit given there is significantly less visitors than July

Ok big deal right? Obviously there is going to be an increase in visitors because the population increased! BUT...

>As recent times has shown, there are overused trail systems such as the Appalachian Trail that spans the east coast and even the number of climbers are limited per year at snow capped mountains such as Mt. Rainier in Washington. Is now a good time to mention you have to carry your poop with you down the mountain? It is apparent that more and more people are getting in touch with their inner "tree hugger" selves to finding peace from their busy lives in the tranquility and solitude of nature.

## Measuring increased interest
In order to measure the level of interest in visiting Yellowstone I calculated the percentage of both the world, and that of the United (U.S.), that potentially visited Yellowstone from 1979 - 2018. I found these percentages by dividing the total popultion of the world by the total visitors for each year, I then did the same with the U.S. population. I hypothesized that there would be an increase in interest of visiting Yellowstone over the 40 years, with the U.S. having a greater potential due to it's proximity.

There is a slight increase in the percentage of the US population but only about 0.5%. The percentage of the world that visited Yellowstone showed no increase at all. Again this could be due to the population of the U.S. being in much closer in proximity to Yellowstone. 

## Takeaway
* Yellowstone has in fact grown in popularity since 1979 with the most popular months falling between late spring and early fall
* Some things to consider with this study are the variables that were not taken into account such as weather and economy  
* The world's love for nature may be on the rise but according to my results not necessarily here at Yellowstone 
* But, need I remind you that **carrying your poop** down Mt. Rainier is protocol? It's true, Google it.
