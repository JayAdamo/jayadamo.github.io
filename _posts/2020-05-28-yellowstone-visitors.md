# **Yellowstone National Park: 40 years of increased visitation**    
## A brief synopsis of when guests visit and the increase in interest explained    
---

## Introduction  
Yellowstone National Park, best known for it's aptly named geyser "_Olde Faithful_", experienced an **enourmous increase in visitors from 1979 to 2018**. This project was intended to find the _**contrast of the number of visitors between the different seasons**_, and based on rising interest in the outdoors overall, if there was an _**increase in the interest of visiting Yellowstone**_ specifically. I was able to address these questions using visitor data collected from the National Park Service as well as population data based on the United States census and worldometer.com. Let's dig in, shall we? 

## About Yellowstone  
This national park consists of **3,500 square miles of wilderness situated atop of a volcanic hot spot**. Although most of the park is in Wyoming, this recreation area spreads into parts of Montana and Idaho as well. In addition to the dramatic canyons, alpine rivers and lush forests, Yellowstone National park features **hot springs and gushing geysers**. This park also home to a variety of wildlife, including bears, wolves, bison, elk and antelope.

## Visitors 1979 - 2018 
During this 40 year span Yellowstone saw the number of guests increase from roughly 1.9 million in 1979 to an estimated 327 million in 2018.

> As you can see  from the graph above there is a general trend showing the increase in visitors. Take note of the peaks and valleys, or increases and decreases in visitors. This author can only theorize that these dips are based on weather conditions or the state of the economy of those particualr points in time. Of course further research would have to be done to pinpoint the exact reasoning behind the rise and fall in the number of guests.  

Okay, we got through that... Stay with me now as we look at when visitors flocked to the land of hot springs and geysers. 

# Visitors in Winter vs. Spring
I chose to compare the least busiest month of January to represent

During the least busiest month, January there does not seem to be any signicance to an increase or decrease of visitors 
During the busiest month, July there is a signicant increase of visitors

## Reasons for stagnation in winter?:
* Winter access is limited to snowshoes/x-country skiing
* Extreme cold temperatures, high winds and frequent snowstorms

Well you are probably thinking "no duh", who wants to enjoy nature in these conditions?
